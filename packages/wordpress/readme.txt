= Script Vault — The Killer Feature =

Most cookie consent plugins just show a banner. **This plugin actually blocks your tracking scripts** until the user consents.

Simply paste your Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, Hotjar, or any tracking code into the **Script Vault** tab in settings. The scripts will only load after the visitor clicks "Accept All". No coding required.

= Built by Rayels Consulting =

[Rayels Consulting](https://rayelsconsulting.com/tools/loi25-wordpress-plugin) is a Montreal-based digital agency specializing in web development, AI automation, and digital marketing. We built this plugin to help Quebec businesses comply with Loi 25 without expensive solutions or monthly fees. That's why it's **100% free** — because compliance shouldn't cost extra.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/rayels-loi25` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Go to **Settings > Loi 25** to configure your banner.
4. (Optional) Paste your tracking scripts into the **Script Vault** tab.
5. Done! The banner appears automatically for new visitors.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this really free? =
Yes, 100% free and open source (MIT license). No premium version, no upsells.

= Does it actually block cookies? =
Yes! Use the **Script Vault** to paste your tracking code. It will only execute after the visitor accepts cookies. This is true Loi 25 compliance.

= Does it work with Google Tag Manager? =
Yes. Enable **Google Consent Mode v2** in settings. It automatically manages `ad_storage`, `analytics_storage`, `ad_user_data`, and `ad_personalization` consent signals.

= Can I customize the text? =
Yes. The **Custom Text** tab lets you override the title, message, and button text in both French and English.

= Does it slow down my site? =
No. The entire plugin is under 10KB of vanilla JavaScript with zero external dependencies.

= What happens when I uninstall? =
All plugin data (settings and statistics) is completely removed from your database. Clean uninstall.

= Can visitors change their consent? =
Yes. A small floating cookie button lets visitors re-open the banner at any time.

= Will my changes show immediately if I use a caching plugin? =
Yes. The plugin automatically flushes the cache from popular caching plugins (WP Rocket, LiteSpeed, W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, and more) whenever you save settings.
